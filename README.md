# Seach WordPress Dashboard with ID

In many occation, I stumbled upon sites that have shortcodes to posts, custom post type entries and what not. Quickly going over to those posts or entries can be troublesome if there are hundreds – thousands of them. I used to put the ID at the browser URL to bring them up but that is too much to do. That’s where this plugin will be helpful. Just go over to your dashboard and search for the post with the ID. Be sure to search in correct post type.
